Hangman Game README.

This app creates a hangman game using Javascript and the Bootstrap Framework.

It is designed to:
1. Randomly pull a word from an array of words
2. Change each letter to dashes
3. Append the dashes to the DOM
4. Allow the user to guess letters
5. If the letter guessed is correct, replace the dash. If it is incorrect, a dash is not replaced.
6. If all the letters in the word are found before the counter reaches 0, the user wins. If it reaches 0 without getting all of the letters right, the user loses.
